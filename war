There were two sides.
Which was right? Which was wrong? I couldn't tell you.
Both sides knew that they were right, and the other was not.

They wanted control.
Having control of this, meant control over everything.
All, or nothing.

After countless invasions, they found equal ground.
Rotating control, based on their strengths and weaknesses.
Switching, not always equally, but happily.

Later, there came smaller sides.
Offering their help when neither were quite right.
A lasting peace. Finally.

The two original sides maintained majority.
An unconventional truce.
But, in times like these, survival comes first.

They never got to know one another.
Fighting side-by-side.
One battle at a time.
